<div class="About">

<p><b> David Orobosa Omoregie[6] was born on 5 June 1998 in the Brixton area of South London, the youngest of three sons born to Nigerian parents from the Edo ethnic group. His father, Frank Omoregie, is a pastor and his mother, Juliet Doris Omoregie, a nurse. Dave's father was deported to Nigeria when Dave was just a few months old as he believed he was travelling on a missionary visa but instead was on a visitor's visa. Juliet was allowed to stay to raise her sons. He was raised in nearby Streatham, where he began composing music at an early age, regularly writing lyrics in his early teens, even before engaging in production after his mother gave him a piano when he was 14. As of April 2019, Dave's brother Christopher is in prison, having been sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 18 years for his involvement in the March 2010 gang murder of 15-year-old Sofyen Belamouadden at London Victoria station; their other brother, Benjamin, was jailed for four years for conspiracy to defraud.

    Dave attended St Mark's Academy, a Church of England school in Mitcham, and, later, Richmond upon Thames College in Twickenham, where he studied law, philosophy, and ethics while also completing an additional module in sound design and politics. He secured a place at De Montfort University in Leicester to study law but never attended, choosing instead to focus on his musical career. Dave is also an avid supporter of Manchester United F.C.</p>
